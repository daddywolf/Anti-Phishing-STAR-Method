# Educating Non-Technical Employees to Identify Phishing Emails through the STAR Method

In today's digital era, phishing emails have emerged as a significant cybersecurity threat. These seemingly harmless messages carry the potential risk to personal information and corporate data. With the increasing sophistication and finesse of phishing attacks, identifying them can be particularly challenging for non-technical staff. To address this, I've devised a simple yet highly effective method - the STAR method, aimed at empowering everyone to recognize and deal with phishing emails. Let's delve deeper.

## Stop

In our fast-paced work environment, it's easy to react to emails impulsively. However, when you receive an email with a link or an attachment, the first step is to pause. Even if the email claims to be an urgent request, maintain a healthy level of skepticism. Curiosity might lead you into risky situations, so before you click, stop and think.

## Think

Next, take a moment to consider whether the email makes sense. Is it asking for sensitive information such as passwords, banking details, or personal identification information? If the email promises something seemingly too good to be true, like a free lunch or an unexpected bonus, ask yourself if it really sounds plausible. Common sense here is a powerful tool.

## Analysis

Now, it's time for a closer inspection. Examine the sender's details for any spelling or grammatical errors, check if the displayed URL matches the actual URL when you hover over it, and scrutinize any QR code and the content for authenticity. This step is crucial in sharpening your skills to spot phishing attempts, especially those well-crafted ones that are hard to identify at first glance.

## Report

Finally, if you suspect the email is phishing, or if you cannot confirm its legitimacy, report or forward it to your security team. This action not only potentially prevents a security threat but also contributes to a culture of vigilance within your organization.

The STAR method provides a clear, systematic strategy for non-technical staff to identify phishing emails effectively. By incorporating these steps, you can play a pivotal role in safeguarding your personal information and your organization's digital assets against the ever-evolving threat of phishing attacks.
